Hi all!

This is my computing project from the 2020 A-level OCR Computing series. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances the A-level coursework is no longer in use. However, I spent a lot of time on this and would like to keep it online.

No music or sprites (except three of the trainer sprites) used in the game were created by me and were instead taken from various online sources. Some sources include Spriter's Resource, Homestuck, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Undertale (the 'LOSE.mp3' track is 'DETERMINATION'), and Pokemon.
